  <h1>Extended Defunc Interpreter</h1>
  <p>
    <br>Defunc is an esoteric functional programming language created by Obvious#5283, and then modified by me for this page.
    <br>Functions are called by putting the function name on the left and then the arguments to the right.
    <br>Functions are defined by naming the new function, choosing variable names, and then writing the return value of the function (which must be another function).
    <br>Valid variable names are any function that has not been defined; this also permanently reserved for the remainder of the program.
    <br>You can only reference functions defined earlier in the file, though recursion is allowed.
    <br>All tokens are one character. This page uses UTF-8.
    <br>Newlines separate functions. All other characters, except the predefined functions below, are not special characters.
    <br>Numbers are standard javascript doubles; don't expect things to work perfectly above 2^53.
    <br>There are 5 standard builtin functions:
    <br>  0 (returns numberical value 0)
    <br>  +a (returns a+1)
    <br>  ?abtf (if a>b, return t; else return f)
    <br>  .a (outputs and returns a)
    <br>  亂a (returns a random number in [0,a]) (that means "random" in chinese)
    <br>There are 2 more builtins, which can be replicated with existing functions: (they're here for performance purposes)
    <br>  Arci?ciA+rc+ir (if c>i, return r+c-i; else return r)
    <br>  *ab?b0Aa*aA0b+000 (return a*b)

  <label>Output as characters? (default is numbers)</label><input type="checkbox" id="outputtype"><br>
  <label>Disable errors? (allows easy comments)</label><input type="checkbox" id="errors"><br>
  <label>Enable constants? (Saves performance but expects all 0 arg functions to be constants (no . or 亂))</label><input type="checkbox" id="consts"><br>
